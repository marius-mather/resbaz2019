# Session Descriptions

## The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp)

Lead: Rachel Hendery

Helper: Tom Honeyman

Tuesday - Thursday

This is a 3 day unconference for humanities researchers with an interest in technology. The agenda for the unconference is set on the first day. The areas covered are up to the participants. In last year's THATCamp, we covered topics like web scraping, mapping, text analysis, Trove, tools for music analysis, Omeka and visual analysis tools.

For a sense of how THATCamps generally run, see their <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">main site</a>.

## Introduction to R for Reproducible Research

Lead: Evan Matthews

Instructors: Belinda Fabian, Richard Miller

[Website](https://jematthews1.github.io/2019-09-10-RezbazSyd-IntroR/)

Tuesday - Wednesday

Are you looking for more efficient methods to analyse large datasets?  This beginners' workshop introduces R-Studio and the R programming language.  Using real datasets it teaches data management techniques including how to structure, manipulate and visualise data.  No previous knowledge is required.  Note: For the full Software Carpentry experience, students are requested to attend the Git and Shell lessons, providing a solid foundational basis for transparent and reproducible research. Students may also be interested in more data manipulation in the SQL workshop

## Introduction to Python

Lead: Brian Ballsun-Stanton

Instructors: Conrad Gillard

[Website](https://denubis.github.io/2019-09-10-RezbazSyd-IntroPython/)

Tuesday - Wednesday

This beginners' workshop will introduce programming and data analysis with Python. We will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, data management, and task automation. No previous knowledge required. Note: For the full Software Carpentry experience, students are requested to attend the Git and Shell lessons, providing a solid foundational basis for transparent and reproducible research. Students may also be interested in more data manipulation in the SQL workshop

## Introduction to REDCap

Lead: Olya Ryjenko

Instructors: David Jung, Taylor Syme, Aidan Wilson

Tuesday morning

Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a powerful and widely used electronic data capture platform, designed to replace paper-based surveys and spreadsheet-based data capture systems. Aimed at beginners, this workshop covers topics that include: creating a REDCap project and instruments/forms, overview of various field types, branching logic, adding/editing records, tracking data entry and access management.

## Languages Showdown

Lead: Anastasios Papaioannou

Instructors: Simon Yin

Tuesday morning

Not sure which language is for you? In this showdown we'll cover the differences between *R, Python, Matlab and Julia*. In which disciplines are these languages found and why? What are the quirks and strengths of each language.

If you're new to programming and are confused about which one to learn, come along to find out more.

## Julia Taster

Lead: Anastasios Papaioannou

Tuesday afternoon

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language with more than 1700 external libraries available. Julia allows you to range from tight low-level loops and conditionals, up to a high-level programming style, with its performance approaching and often matching the performance of the fastest programming languages! But what if you're just getting started – with Julia and, more generally, with programming?

Nothing beats a hands-on, face-to-face training session to get you past the inevitable syntax errors!

Join us for this live coding workshop where we write programs that produce results, using Jupyter notebooks, which allow program code, results, visualisations and documentation to be blended seamlessly.

Learning Outcomes:

- Basic syntax, and basic concepts in Julia
- How to import powerful libraries

## Geospatial data analysis using R

Lead: Darya Vanichkina

Instructors: Alireza Kharazami, Steefan Contractor

Wednesday - Thursday

Are you an R user who’s really wanted to work with geospatial data? In this workshop, we’ll introduce key geospatial concepts, then explore them using live coding with the Data Carpentry Geospatial Curriculum.  We’ll also talk about some Australian-specific things that are not in the main Carpentries, but are useful if you’re working with this data down under. PREREQUISITE: you need to be COMFORTABLE using R, and debugging your own scripts.

## Visualisation in R

Lead: Anastasios Papaioannou

Instructors: Ghulam Murtaza

Wednesday

Learn visualisation techniques in R using the ggplot2 package

## Longitudinal Trials with REDCap

Lead: Aidan Wilson

Instructors: David Jung, Olya Ryjenko

Wednesday morning

This workshop introduces some of REDCap’s more advanced features for running longitudinal studies. Aimed at intermediate/advanced users, this workshop covers topics that include: building a longitudinal project, managing participants through multiple events, configuring and using Automated Survey Invitations (ASI), using Smart Variables to add powerful features to your logic and understanding data structure of a longitudinal project.

## Introduction to SQL

Lead: Brian Ballsun-Stanton

Instructors: Richard Miller

Thursday

This Software Carpentry inspired workshop will present the Using Databases and SQL lesson. This workshop is appropriate for beginners with no programming knowledge. We will use a dataset inspired by William Dyer, Frank Pabodie, and Valentina Roerich's expeditions to the Pole of Inaccessibility in the South Pacific to learn how to explore, manipulate, and create a database. Databases include powerful tools for search and analysis, and can handle large, complex data sets -- and can scale more effectively than spreadsheets.

## Visualisation in Python

Lead: Anastasios Papaioannou

Instructors: Weisi Chen

Thursday

Learn visualisation techniques in Python using the Seaborn and the Matplotlib libraries.

## Regular Expressions

Lead: Aidan Wilson

Thursday morning

An <a href="https://intersect.org.au/training/course/regex101/">introductory course</a> for regular expressions.

## Introduction to Unix

Lead: William McLean

Instructors: Nathaniel Butterworth, Timothy Amos

[Website](https://denubis.github.io/2019-09-10-RezbazSyd-IntroPython/)

Thursday morning

This beginners’ workshop will introduce students to the command line. Students will learn how to navigate the file system, work with documents, automate tasks and write and execute scripts. No previous knowledge required. Especially beneficial for attendees of the R and python courses on days 1 – 2.

## Introduction to Git and version control

Lead: William McLean

Instructors: Nathaniel Butterworth, Timothy Amos

[Website](https://denubis.github.io/2019-09-10-RezbazSyd-IntroPython/)

Thursday afternoon

Do you want to make sure you never lose your work? Never have a supervisor accidentally delete a critical analysis result? See exactly which code you ran 7 months ago? This beginners’ workshop will introduce students to version control using git – a magic tool that does all this and more! No previous knowledge required. Especially beneficial for attendees of the R and python courses on days 1 – 2.
